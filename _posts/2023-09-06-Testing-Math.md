title: Numerical methods class
---

This term I am taking a grad class on numerical methods in physics. I look forward to it, and hopefully sharing some nice things I learn!

Okay, so first class just got over. Very cool prof, he's written his own book for the subject and also a website for it! Do check out: [https://numphyspy.org](https://numphyspy.org). Also, I will *not* be sharing assignments publicly as it is a university course.

What I do think would be cool is exploring the textbook as I read it in this blogpost!
