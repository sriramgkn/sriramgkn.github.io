title: Numerical methods class
---

This term, I am taking a graduate class on numerical methods in physics. I look forward to it, and hopefully sharing some nice things I learn!

Okay, so first class just got over. Cool prof, he's written his own book on the subject and also a website for it. Do check out: [https://numphyspy.org](https://numphyspy.org). Also, I will not be sharing assignments publicly for obvious reasons.

What I do think would be cool is exploring the textbook together as I read it. Also probably a good excuse to test mathjax on this blog. Hello Hello Hello
