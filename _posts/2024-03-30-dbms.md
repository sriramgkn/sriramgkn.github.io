title: Practical use of SQL in relational databases
---

In this post, we will use SQL to query a plant disease dataset loaded both as MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. We will also compare the capabilities of each database in general and specific to our example task.

## MySQL vs PostgreSQL - General Comparison

### SQL Compliance
- PostgreSQL is more SQL compliant and supports more advanced SQL features like window functions, CTEs, INTERSECT, etc.
- MySQL has some deviations from SQL standards but has been improving compliance in recent versions.

### Performance
- MySQL is known to perform better for read-heavy workloads, which is why it's popular for web applications. It's faster for simple read queries.
- PostgreSQL performs better for complex queries, large datasets, and read-write workloads. It has a more sophisticated query optimizer.

### Replication
- MySQL has built-in master-slave replication and some clustering solutions, but may require 3rd party tools for more advanced setups.
- PostgreSQL has built-in synchronous replication which makes it easier to setup high availability.

### Concurrency
- PostgreSQL handles concurrency better with its Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) architecture. Readers don't block writers.
- MySQL traditionally used table-level locking but has improved with row-level locking in recent versions. Still, it doesn't handle high concurrency as well as PostgreSQL.

### Full Text Search
- PostgreSQL has built-in full text search capabilities.
- MySQL has full text search but it requires special setup and configuration.

### Data Types
- PostgreSQL supports a wider range of data types including native support for arrays, hstore (key-value pairs), and advanced geometric/spatial types.
- MySQL has a more limited set of data types. It has spatial extensions but not as advanced as PostGIS.

### Extensibility
- PostgreSQL is highly extensible. You can create custom data types, operators, index types, etc. Popular extensions include PostGIS, pg_trgm, hstore.
- MySQL is less extensible. It allows user-defined functions but not new data types or operators.

### Stored Procedures
- Both support stored procedures but PostgreSQL allows them to be written in multiple languages (PL/pgSQL, PL/Python, PL/Perl, etc.)
- MySQL stored procedures are written in SQL with some extensions.

### Licensing
- Both are open source but MySQL has a dual licensing model - GPL open source and commercial. It's owned by Oracle.
- PostgreSQL is fully open source under the permissive PostgreSQL license. Owned by a non-profit.

## MySQL vs PostgreSQL for the Plant Disease Dataset Example

For the specific use case of storing and analyzing the plant disease image dataset:

### Schema Design
The relational schema would be very similar in both databases - a table to store image paths and labels with foreign keys to dimension tables for crops and diseases if needed.

PostgreSQL's ability to create custom types could be useful to create a special 'image' type but not strictly necessary. MySQL's lack of transactional DDL is a drawback during initial schema creation and modifications.

### Data Loading
Both databases can load the data from CSV files or using programming languages. 

PostgreSQL's COPY command is very efficient for bulk inserts. MySQL's LOAD DATA INFILE is also fast.

For loading images or metadata, PostgreSQL's native JSON support is an advantage. You could store image metadata as a JSON column. With MySQL you'd have to use a TEXT column and handle parsing in application code.

### Querying
Most of the queries needed would be simple filters and aggregations which both can handle well.

For more complex queries that categorize images along multiple dimensions or look for patterns, PostgreSQL's window functions and CTEs would be useful. The query optimizer would also likely generate more efficient execution plans.

Full text search on metadata could be done in PostgreSQL without any additional setup.

### Performance
For simple read queries like "select all images for crop X", MySQL would likely be faster, especially with indexing.

As queries get more complex with joins, aggregations and analytics, PostgreSQL is likely to perform better, especially with large data volumes.

Write performance is likely to be better with PostgreSQL due to MVCC.

### Geospatial
If there is a geospatial component to the data, like field locations, PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension would provide advanced capabilities for geospatial indexing and queries that MySQL cannot match.

### Machine Learning
For advanced analytics and machine learning, the ability to do more in-database with PostgreSQL is an advantage. You can use extensions like MADlib for in-database ML. With MySQL you'd have to extract data to another tool.

### Conclusion
In summary, while both databases could be made to work, PostgreSQL is likely the better choice for this use case due to:

- Ability to handle complex queries and analytics as the application grows
- Native JSON support for unstructured metadata
- Geospatial capabilities with PostGIS
- Ability to do in-database machine learning
- Better handling of concurrency for write workloads

The main advantage of MySQL would be faster performance for simple read queries, but that's likely outweighed by PostgreSQL's other benefits as the application scales and becomes more complex. The strong developer community and momentum behind PostgreSQL is also a factor in its favor.
