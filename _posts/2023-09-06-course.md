title: Computational Physics class

This term, I am taking a graduate class titled "Special Topics in Computational Physics". I look forward to it, and hopefully sharing some nice things I learn.

Check out: [https://numphyspy.org](https://numphyspy.org).

One of the coolest things I learnt was solving a system of ODEs in Python (without built-in functions). What makes this class of problems cool is that - depending on how we formulate the problem, approaches to solve them can really explore the full glory of numerical methods: linear algebra, finite differences, integration, and root finding.
