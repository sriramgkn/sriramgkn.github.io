This term, I am taking a graduate class titled "Special Topics in Computational Physics". I look forward to it, and hopefully sharing some nice things I learn.

Check out: [https://numphyspy.org](https://numphyspy.org).

One of the coolest things I learnt was solving a system of ODEs in Python (without built-in functions). What makes this class of problems cool is that - depending on how we formulate the problem, approaches to solve them can really explore the full glory of numerical methods: linear algebra, finite differences, integration, and root finding.

When $a \neq 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.
$$
