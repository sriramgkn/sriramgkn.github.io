This page is dedicated to personal opinions, thoughts, and random things I find cool in the real and virtual world!

If there's one thing I've appreciated about science all the way since high school, it is the power of geometric intuition. Geometric intuition underlies not just physics and mathematics, but practically everything humans can imagine and create. While I couldn't prioritize Machine Learning as an undergrad, I'm quite excited about teaching it to myself! I'm currently going through [these](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) wonderful lectures rigorously.

### Movie suggestions
- 2020: Tenet, WW84, Enola Holmes, Extraction, Greyhound, The Outpost, The Gentlemen, Jojo Rabbit, 1917, Parasite, Knives Out.

### Recent book-reads
- Immortals of Meluha, Amish Tripathi
- The subtle art of not giving a f*ck, Mark Manson

<!-- ### Indian food
Good food deserves appreciation! I'm used to eating the following as an Indian
- Basics: Sambar, Rasam, Masoor Dal - with Cooked Rice
- Curries/Gravies: Cauliflower, GreenBeans, Carrot, Paneer, Okra, Cabbage, Spinach - with Chapati
- Breakfast: All types of Dosas, Rava Idli, Upma, Pongal, Poha - with Chutney -->

### Free Knowledge
I greatly appreciate massive efforts to make digital knowledge and multimedia freely accessible to the world. Even more so when such content is available in secure [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) sites with an ad-free experience (although it's generally good to use [adblock-plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) at all times)

Here are some of my favorites: [Z library](https://b-ok.asia/), [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se/), [TinyZone](https://tinyzonetv.to/), [GetComics](https://getcomics.info/)

Some useful YouTube playlists: [MIT-OCW](https://www.youtube.com/c/mitocw/playlists?view=1&sort=dd&flow=grid), [Stanford-Online](https://www.youtube.com/user/stanfordonline/playlists), [Useful MOOCs](https://www.youtube.com/user/intrigano/playlists)

### 1998 - 2020
I was born in the year 1998 in Thane, India. I have very little memory of Thane, since we soon moved to Hyderabad in 2000, where I stayed till 2005. This was where I first watched Tom & Jerry, Pokemon, live Cricket, colored everything I possibly could, and cycled at top speed on awesome slopes in the colony roads. But this was also where my innocent mind first pondered about the idea of death, and I asked my mother: what happens after death? This was when I first felt the sorrow reality of people leaving the world. Although I got over the sorrow quickly, I still retain a distinct mental picture of the moment, as it continues to be a profound question to this day.

We moved to Chennai in 2005, and stayed there till 2011. As a 7 year old, I found practically everything enjoyable! All of life seemed like an awesome game. I loved playing hide-and-seek with friends, and also just roaming around the apartment, which felt like a beautiful maze with many secret routes! (It was basically two 10 storey buildings, but also had connecting regions in the ground floor, 1st floor and 10th floor. Additionally, the ground floor had a bank office, while the 1st and 10th floor connectors had huge open terraces. Also, there was a basement below ground floor that could be accessed from two very different parts of the apartment!). As I grew a little older, I enjoyed playing cricket and football in the open, TT in the apartment basement, UNO cards, and video games in my friend's apartment. And as I grew a little older than that, I started prioritizing an interest in math and science. Following my brother, I joined fiitjee, a popular coaching class for competitive exams in India. At the time, in 7th and 8th grade, things weren't that serious still, so although I struggled to cope with the competition initially, the classes were quite enjoyable eventually.

I have been to 4 countries outside India till date. One trip was to Singapore and Malaysia in 2008. I have fond memories of Sentosa Island, Petronas towers, and Genting Highlands in this trip. In another trip, I visited Hong Kong and Macau in 2012. Some memorable places I visited there include Disney Land, Ocean Park, Madam Tussauds, and the Venetian hotel.

In 2011, we moved to Bangalore. Here, we lived in a fairly large colony, but I somehow felt the "apartment culture" of Chennai was missing. I didn't venture out and play much, except for evening walks with my parents. Given a new found interest in math and science, and an amazing set of friends at fiitjee bangalore's weekend classes, I decided to spend most of my free time solving interesting math and physics problems. And in retrospect, I don't regret that decision one bit, as it paid off quite well in the long run. From 8th to 10th grade, my schedule was more or less regular. I enjoyed football at school, math at home, and fiitjee classes during weekends! The real struggle (and joy by virtue of struggle) began in 11th grade, when I joined fiitjee's integrated school in bangalore preparing for JEE advanced, the most competitive exam in India to get admission into the IITs. Thanks to my earlier background with weekend classes in 9th and 10th, I managed to cope with academic pressure rather well. Although JEE 2016 turned out to be a nightmare of a paper, I was lucky enough not to mess it up entirely, and thus began my journey at IIT Madras from August 2016, back in Chennai again!

I joined the Engineering Physics program at IITM, where students get a chance to take professional courses in both Physics and EE. And given how diversified EE is today, I had enormous flexibility to explore a wide variety of areas at the intersection of Physics, EECS and Applied Math. But apart from academics, I'll forever miss the campus (a 600 acre forest in the heart of the city), the hostel culture (I played TT and football casually), and above all, my friend groups. Academically too, I've been fortunate to interact with some phenomenally smart people, both on campus and at internships outside.

Around mid-March 2020, we got a sudden notice to leave campus in a week due to COVID spreading in India. On 19th March 2020, I took a train back home to Bangalore. Little did I know that 19th March would be my last official day on campus, and the batch of 2020 would graduate without a real convocation. The first two months of lockdown were some of the most dreadful days of my life. I was juggling some extremely technical courses, a thesis project, and Ph.D. interviews at the same time. Thankfully, I managed to get a Ph.D. admit from IQC Waterloo in April. That was a huge relief, and allowed to me to focus on my courses and research a lot more peacefully. The last semester ended online in June, although I continued "virtual research" for much longer. Meanwhile, graduate school began online in September, and has been fairly smooth so far.

So that brings me to today, Jan 6th 2021! Looking forward to writing more.
