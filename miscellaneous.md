This page is dedicated to personal opinions, thoughts, and random things I find cool in the real and virtual world!

If there's one thing I've appreciated about science all the way since high school, it is the power of geometric intuition. Geometric intuition underlies not just physics and mathematics, but practically everything humans can imagine and create. While I couldn't prioritize Machine Learning as an undergrad, I'm quite excited about teaching it to myself! I'm currently going through [these](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU) wonderful lectures rigorously.

### free knowledge
I greatly appreciate massive efforts to make digital knowledge and multimedia freely accessible to the world. Even more so when such content is available in secure [https](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) sites with an ad-free experience (although it's generally good to use [adblock-plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-plus-free-ad-bloc/cfhdojbkjhnklbpkdaibdccddilifddb) at all times)

Here are some of my favorites: [Z library](https://b-ok.asia/), [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.se/), [TinyZone](https://tinyzonetv.to/), [GetComics](https://getcomics.info/)

Some useful YouTube playlists: [MIT-OCW](https://www.youtube.com/c/mitocw/playlists?view=1&sort=dd&flow=grid), [Stanford-Online](https://www.youtube.com/user/stanfordonline/playlists), [Useful MOOCs](https://www.youtube.com/user/intrigano/playlists)
