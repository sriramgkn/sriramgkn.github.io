My site is [here](https://sriramgkn.github.io)

[This](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/) is the template I use. 

<!-- ## Credits
Many thanks to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for this clean, free template.

To make a similar blog of your own:
- Fork [this](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/) repository (or mine)
- In the repo settings, rename the repo as **username.github.io**
- Wait for a minute or two. Your site will be hosted by GitHub for free!
- Now to edit the template:
  - Basic details can be updated in **_config.yml** and **about.md**
  - Blog posts can be created as [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files (.md) and uploaded in the directory **_posts** -->
