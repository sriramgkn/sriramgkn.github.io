My name is Sriram. I recently completed an M.Sc. degree in Physics at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), and earlier completed a B.Tech. degree in Engineering Physics at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). My top hobbies are cooking, table tennis, and running. Recently, I have been blogging actively in the blog section of this website.
