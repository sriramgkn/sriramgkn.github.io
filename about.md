I'm a Physics PhD student at [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), and [IQC](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) in Waterloo, Canada. Earlier, I got an undergrad degree in Engineering Physics from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), India.

I'm very broadly interested in the area of quantum information science. I like to view research from a basic mathematical lens rooted in geometry & computation. When away from a computer screen, I try my best to explore the natural outdoor world we live in.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
