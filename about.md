I am a physics graduate student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), and earlier an engineering physics undergrad at [IITM](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in India.

Check out the projects section for past work. Currently in research, I am into the subject of "quantum learning theory". The central question is - what is the complexity of learning (to chosen precision) properties of a chosen many-body quantum state prepared in an experiment? The problem also goes by the name "tomography" for its natural similarity to imaging tech.

I am also currently looking for opportunities to build tech-industry experience in Canada, with a special interest in data science roles - production and deployment of ML models in real-world settings.
