I'm a physics graduate student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), and earlier an engineering physics undergrad at [IITM](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in India. Check out the projects section for past work.

Currently I'm into the subject of "quantum learning theory", central question being - what is the complexity of learning properties of a quantum state prepared in an experiment? The problem also goes by the name "tomography" for its conceptual similarity to imaging tech.

Also currently - seeking opportunities to build experience in production and deployment of ML models in real-world settings.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
