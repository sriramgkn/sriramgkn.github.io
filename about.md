Hi, I'm Sriram, a grad student in physics researching quantum information theory at [IQC](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) and [Perimeter](https://perimeterinstitute.ca) in Waterloo, Canada. Previously, I spent four formative years (2016-20) at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in Chennai, India, culminating in an undergrad degree in engineering physics.

I'm broadly interested in the physics and math of quantum information. Alongside, I like reading about neuroscience, dynamical systems, random processes, and convex optimization. Away from math and science, I enjoy casual reading, old movies, playing football, and editing this blog.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
