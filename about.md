Hello there. I'm a graduate student in Physics with the Perimeter Institute and IQC in Waterloo, Canada. I recently graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with an undergrad degree in Engineering Physics.

Broadly, I'm interested in both the physics and math of Quantum Information. Alongside, I share a keen interest in convex optimization, dynamical systems, and stochastic processes.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
