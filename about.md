Hi, I'm a physics graduate student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), and was earlier an engineering physics undergrad at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in India. check out the projects section for past work.

Currently into the subject of "quantum learning theory", where a central question is - what is the complexity of learning properties of a many-body quantum state prepared in an experiment? the problem also goes by the name "tomography" for its conceptual similarity to imaging technology.

Also currently - seeking opportunities to build experience in production and deployment of ML models in real-world settings.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
