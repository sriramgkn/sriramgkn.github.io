Hi there! I'm Sriram, a grad student in physics researching quantum information theory at [IQC](https://perimeterinstitute.ca) and [Perimeter](https://perimeterinstitute.ca) in a stimulating yet relaxed town of Waterloo in Canada. Previously, I was very fortunate to spend four beautiful years at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in Chennai, India, culminating in an undergrad degree in engineering physics.

I'm broadly interested in both the physics and math of quantum information. Alongside, I also love learning ideas from neuroscience, dynamical systems, random processes, and convex optimization. Away from math and science, I enjoy casual reading, old movies, playing football, and editing this blog!

If you enjoy scientific discussions on quantum computing/neuroscience/physics or math generally, feel free to reach out at: [sriramgk98@gmail.com](mailto:sriramgk98@gmail.com)

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
