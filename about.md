I am a grad student with [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), [IQC](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), and [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) in Canada. Earlier, I got an undergrad degree in Engineering Physics from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), India.

I am currently interested in bridging [quantum information science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_information_science) with [statistical learning theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_learning_theory). I like to view research from a basic mathematical lens rooted in geometry & computation. When away from a computer screen, I like playing sports and exploring the natural outdoor world around us.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
