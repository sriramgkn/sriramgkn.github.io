I am a physics graduate student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), and earlier an engineering physics undergrad at [IITM](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in India. check out the projects section for past work.

currently, I am into the subject of "quantum learning theory". the central question is - what is the complexity of learning properties of a quantum state prepared in an experiment? the problem also goes by the name "tomography" for its conceptual similarity to imaging tech.

also currently - seeking opportunities build experience in production and deployment of ML systems in real-world settings

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
