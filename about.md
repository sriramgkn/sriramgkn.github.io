I'm a PhD student in Physics at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), [IQC](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/), and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca) in Waterloo, Canada. Earlier, I received an undergraduate degree in Engineering Physics from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), India.

I'm broadly interested in the field of quantum information theory. Alongside, I like learning more about general breakthroughs in technology, mathematics, and science. I like to view research from a basic mathematical lens rooted in geometry & computation.

Outside my hostel at IITM! The COVID-19 pandemic forced us out of this beautiful campus with little notice. -->
