I am a physics graduate student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), and earlier completed an undergraduate degree in engineering physics at [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). Currently into "quantum learning theory", where a central question is - what is the complexity of learning properties of a many-body quantum state prepared in an experiment? The problem also goes by the name "tomography" for its conceptual similarity to imaging technology.
