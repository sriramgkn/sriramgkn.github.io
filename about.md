I am a physics graduate student at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) and [Perimeter Institute](https://perimeterinstitute.ca), and earlier an engineering physics undergrad at [IITM](https://www.iitm.ac.in) in India.

check out the projects section for past work. currently in research, I am into the subject of "quantum learning theory", where the central question is - what is the complexity of learning to fixed precision the properties of a chosen quantum many-body state prepared in an experiment? the task also goes by the name "tomography" for its conceptual similarity to imaging technology.

also currently, I am looking for opportunities to build tech-industry experience in Canada, with a special interest in data science roles - production and deployment of ML models in real-world settings.
